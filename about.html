      <h1>A little bit about myself &#127800;</h1>
      <p class="p1">Life's journey led me to Germany and I embraced this new chapter with open arms. I am Lara, a 23-year-old with a heart full of dreams and a passion for front-end engineering.</p>

      <p class="p0">
        Munich became my second index, not by chance, but by choice. It's a place that resonated with my quest for better opportunities and a desire to experience a different corner of the world. Rather than pursuing costly studies in other English-speaking countries, I decided to learn the german language and create my own path. I passed the German language test in São Paulo and got a Visa in Rio de Janeiro, what opened the doors to this vibrant and international city.</p>

        <!-- <p class="p1">
          My journey began as an Au-Pair and later on a Language School Volunteer, allowing me to immerse myself in the local culture and connect with its people. Munich quickly captured my heart. I found not only lifelong friends but also a sense of belonging and the inspiration to pursue a career I never imagined I would be passionate about.</p> -->
        
        <p class="p1">My background in Communications & Design, coupled with a fascination for psychology, laid the foundation for my transformation into the world of Web Development. From the very beginning, I discovered affinity for understanding user needs, designing interfaces and bringing it to life on screens.</p>
        
        <p class="p1">I'm an eternal learner, always expanding my knowledge and skill set. While I may not have mastered programming, I'm excited to begin a journey with hands-on experience where I can grow not only as a front-end engineer but also as an individual. I'm ready to explore the world of web development, where I can design a better version of digital products. </p>
