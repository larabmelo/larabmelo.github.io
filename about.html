      <h1>“You cannot change fate. However, you can rise to meet it, if you so choose.”</h1>
      <p class="p1">Embracing the unknown and taking on challenges has made me who I am. 
My name is Lara, I am a 23-year-old with a passion for front-end engineering. <br> Early in life, way before I actually did it, I decided to take my first professional steps in another country. Growing up in Brazil, you’d think I had everything I could ever want, but of all countries my destiny chose Germany. Here, I decided to delve into a different culture, language and job market of the world, creating an unusual, but my own path.</p>

      <p class="p0">Having studied Communication & Design, and combining it with a profound fascination for psychology, I discovered my passion for web development & front-end engineering. There are three things I love most about it: 
The concept of usability. Finding a shared truth in simplicity, functionality and design. Understanding and interpreting user needs and designing interfaces. 
The implementation of this truth. Making it work and bringing it to life on screens.
Solving complex, ever changing problems & riddles. Expanding my approaches to problem solving.</p>
     
        <p class="p1">Naturally a people-pleaser and perfectionist, I will go out of my way to deliver great projects and learn fast. I strive in environments that are as supportive as they are ambitious. That being said, I'm excited to find out what tasks and people my next chapter will bring. I am looking for hands-on experience and close mentoring to let me reach a new level not only as a front-end engineer but also as an individual and team member.</p>
