        <h2>UX Redesign: Visa Application</h2>
        <br>
        <div>
          <h3 class="overview-title">OVERVIEW</h3>
          <br>
          <p class="overview-description">The Visa Application Redesign project focuses on improving the user experience for students applying for visas in Munich, Germany. Leveraging the Double Diamond Process, the project aimed to identify pain points and opportunities for enhancement within the existing system. 
          </p>
          <p>
            By understanding the unique needs and challenges faced by student visa applicants, the project sought to redesign the website system and architecture to better cater to their requirements. This involved optimizing navigation, improving information accessibility, and enhancing user support mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through iterative design iterations and a user-centric approach, the project aimed to deliver a transformative solution that empowers student visa applicants with a more efficient and streamlined application experience.

        <h2>The project</h2>
        <h3 class="overview-title">DISCOVER PHASE</h3>
        <br>
        <h4 class="project-subtitle">The user</h4>
        <p>The primary users of this platform are immigrants arriving in Munich with diverse objectives, such as pursuing higher education at the university, attending language courses to learn German, or transitioning to new job opportunities. These individuals typically navigate the bureaucratic processes independently to obtain the necessary residence permits for their stay in Germany. For the purpose of this project, I have chosen to focus specifically on the visa application process for students aiming to study in Munich.</p>
        <h4 class="project-subtitle">The research</h4>
        <p>Desk-Research indicates that Munich boasts a diverse population, with non-nationals constituting approximately 23% of its inhabitants, while first and second-generation migrants make up 3.20% of the city's residents. Moreover, the majority group comprises 64% of Munich's population.</p>
        <p>Throughout my nearly two-year-long collaboration with immigrants, particularly those undertaking language courses to learn German and apply for visas, it became apparent that they face significant challenges in comprehending and navigating the visa application process.</p>
        <h4 class="project-subtitle">User Journey</h4>
        <br>
        <img src="/img/user-journey.png" alt="user journey">
        <p>In addition to my research efforts, I arranged user interviews to pinpoint the exact nature of the issues and challenges faced by visa applicants. Furthermore, I curated online user reviews, recognizing their potential significance in elucidating the primary concerns surrounding the visa application process.</p>
        <p>The users  encountered several challenges while navigating the website of the foreigners office for their visa application process. Initially, they struggled to locate relevant information and resorted to contacting the office directly via email and phone. Despite finding information about the visa process, users faced difficulties in booking appointments and completing registration due to unclear website navigation.</p>
        <p>One significant issue mentioned by the users was the lack of direct links to important registration pages, forcing them to use external search engines like Google to find the necessary information. Additionally, they encountered language barriers as all the information on the registration page was in German, making it challenging for non-native speakers to understand the process fully.
          Furthermore, attempts to access the online visa application led to irrelevant pages, adding to users' frustration and confusion. Despite their efforts, users struggled to find clear instructions and support within the website interface.</p>
          <div class="key-findings">
            <div class="key-findings-text">
              <p>These challenges highlighted several key issues with the website of the foreigners office:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Complex and unintuitive website navigation: The lack of direct links and unclear organization made it difficult for users to locate essential information and services.</li>
                <li>Language barriers: The website primarily presented information in German, posing difficulties for non-native speakers seeking to understand the visa application process.</li>
                <li>Lack of clear instructions and support: Users struggled to find clear instructions and support within the website interface, leading to frustration and confusion.</li>
              </ul>

            <img src="img/reviews.png" alt="">
          </div>
          <p>As part of the research, benchmarking was conducted to understand how other cities and countries manage their visa processes, particularly in terms of digitalization. Research was conducted on countries like New Zealand and cities like Sydney to gather insights and best practices in visa processing.</p>
          <h4 class="project-subtitle">Benchmarking</h4>

          </div>
          <h3 class="overview-title">DEFINE PHASE</h3>
          <p>After compiling all of these findings and gathering insights and best practices, I developed a new user journey. This journey serves as the foundation for the next design flows, aimed at enhancing the overall user experience. The goal is to guide users seamlessly through the search, discovery, and achievement phases with as few negative experiences as possible.</p>
          <h4 class="project-subtitle">New User Journey</h4>

          <h4 class="project-subtitle">User Flow</h4>
          <img src="img/user-flow.jpg" alt="">
          <p>To enhance user experience, the visa application process underwent significant improvements. Users can now seamlessly navigate from the homepage to the Immigration and Visas section, where language settings ensure accessibility for all. Clear information on residence permits and application procedures, including a dedicated section for Student Visas, meets users' specific needs. Contact options are readily available for further assistance, while the online application streamlines form submission and document uploads. Confirmation emails provide peace of mind, offering copies of uploaded documents, tracking codes for mailed submissions, and application IDs for status monitoring.</p>
